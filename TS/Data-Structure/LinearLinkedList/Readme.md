Codes are mainly from two websites:

1. www.geeksforgeeks.org

2. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/15-200/lectures/llrecursion/index.html

I modified the codes respectively for educational purposes for my students. As well, I added some of them.

Please note that libraries (used with import) preceeded with comment sign are not implemented yet. They should be implemented as soon as I have time.
